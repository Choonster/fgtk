Scripts
-------


Files
~~~~~

Mostly file/link/dir-entry manipulation tools.


scim set
^^^^^^^^

A set of tools to bind a bunch of scattered files to a single path, with
completely unrelated internal path structure. Intended usage is to link
configuration files to scm-controlled path (repository).

Actually started as `cfgit project`_, but then evolved away from git vcs into a
more generic, not necessarily vcs-related, solution.

.. _cfgit project: http://fraggod.net/code/git/configit/

scim-ln
'''''''

Adds a new link (symlink or catref) to a manifest (links-list), also moving file
to scim-tree (repository) on fs-level.

scim
''''

Main tool to check binding and metadata of files under scim-tree. Basic
operation boils down to two (optional) steps:

* Check files' metadata (uid, gid, mode, acl, posix capabilities) against
  metadata-list (``.scim_meta``, by default), if any, updating the metadata/list
  if requested, except for exclusion-patterns (``.scim_meta_exclude``).

* Check tree against links-list (``.scim_links``), warning about any files /
  paths in the same root, which aren't on the list, yet not in exclusion
  patterns (``.scim_links_exclude``).


others
^^^^^^

pyacl
'''''

Tool to restore POSIX ACLs on paths, broken by chmod or similar stuff without
actually changing them.

fs
''

Complex tool for high-level fs operations. Reference is built-in.

Copy files, setting mode and ownership for the destination::

  fs -m600 -o root:wheel cp * /somepath

Temporarily (1hr) change attributes (i.e. to edit file from user's
editor)::

  fs -t3600 -m600 -o someuser expose /path/to/file

Copy ownership/mode from one file to another::

  fs cps /file1 /file2

fatrace-pipe
''''''''''''

fatrace_-based script to read filesystem write events via linux fanotify_ system
and match them against specific path and app name, sending matches to a FIFO
pipe.

Use-case is to, for example, setup watcher for development project dir changes,
sending instant "refresh" signals to something that renders the project or shows
changes' results otherwise.

FIFO is there because fanotify requires root privileges, and running some
potentially-rm-rf-/ ops as uid=0 is a damn bad idea. User's pid can read lines
from the fifo and react to these safely instead.

Example - run "make" on any change to ``~user/hatch/project`` files::

  (root) ~# fatrace-pipe ~user/hatch/project
  (user) project% xargs -in1 </tmp/fatrace.fifo make

.. _fatrace: https://launchpad.net/fatrace
.. _fanotify: http://lwn.net/Articles/339253/

audit-follow
''''''''''''

Trivial py3 script to decode audit messages from "journalctl -af" output,
i.e. stuff like this::

  Jul 24 17:14:01 malediction audit: PROCTITLE
    proctitle=7368002D630067726570202D652044... (loooong hex-encoded string)

Into this::

  [1327] proctitle='sh -c grep -e Dirty: -e Writeback: /proc/meminfo'

Filters for audit messages only, strips long audit-id/time prefixes,
unless -a/--all specified, puts separators between multi-line audit reports,
relative and/or differential timestamps (-r/--reltime and -d/--difftime opts).

Audit subsystem can be very useful to understand which process modifies some
path or what's the command-line of /bin/bash being occasionally run without need
for strace or where it's inapplicable.

Some useful auditctl incantations (cheatsheet)::

  # auditctl -e 1
  # auditctl -a exit,always -S execve -F path=/bin/bash
  # auditctl -a exit,always -F auid=1001 -S open -S openat
  # auditctl -w /some/important/path/ -p rwxa
  # auditctl -e 0
  # auditctl -D

auditd + ausearch can be used as an offline/advanced alternative to such script.

clean-boot
''''''''''

Script to remove older kernel versions (as installed by ``/sbin/installkernel``)
from ``/boot`` or similar dir.

Always keeps version linked as "vmlinuz", and prioritizes removal of older
patchset versions from each major one, and only then latest per-major patchset,
until free space goal (specified percentage, 20% by default) is met.

Also keeps specified number of last-to-remove versions, can prioritize cleanup
of ".old" verssion variants, keep ``config-*`` files... and other stuff (see
--help).

Example::

  # clean-boot --debug --dry-run -f 100
  DEBUG:root:Preserved versions (linked version, its ".old" variant, --keep-min): 4
  DEBUG:root: - 3.9.9.1 - System.map-3.9.9-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.9.9.1 - config-3.9.9-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.9.9.1 - vmlinuz-3.9.9-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.10.27.1 - vmlinuz-3.10.27-fg.mf_master
  ...
  DEBUG:root: - 3.12.19.1 - System.map-3.12.19-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.12.20.1 - config-3.12.20-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.12.20.1 - System.map-3.12.20-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - 3.12.20.1 - vmlinuz-3.12.20-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.2.0.1
  DEBUG:root: - System.map-3.2.0-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - config-3.2.0-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root: - vmlinuz-3.2.0-fg.mf_master
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.2.1.0
  ... (removal of older patchsets for each major version, 3.2 - 3.12)
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.12.18.1
  ... (this was the last non-latest patchset-per-major)
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.2.16.1
  ... (removing latest patchset for each major version, starting from oldest - 3.2 here)
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.7.9.1
  ...
  DEBUG:root:Removing files for version (df: 58.9%): 3.8.11.1
  ...
  DEBUG:root:Finished (df: 58.9%, versions left: 4, versions removed: 66).

("df" doesn't rise here because of --dry-run, ``-f 100`` = "remove all
non-preserved" - as df can't really get to 100%)

Note how 3.2.0.1 (non-.old 3.2.0) gets removed first, then 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so
on, but 3.2.16 (latest of 3.2.X) gets removed towards the very end, among other
"latest patchset for major" versions, except those that are preserved
unconditionally (listed at the top).

findx
'''''

Wrapper around GNU find to accept paths at the end of argv if none are passed
before query.

Makes it somewhat more consistent with most other commands that accept options
and a lists of paths (almost always after opts), but still warns when/if
reordering takes place.

No matter how many years I'm using that tool, still can't get used to typing
paths before query there, so decided to patch around that frustrating issue one
day.

wgets
'''''

Simple script to grab a file using wget and then validate checksum of the
result, e.g.:

.. code:: console

  $ wgets -c http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-sun4i-latest.tar.gz cea5d785df19151806aa5ac3a917e41c
  Using hash: md5
  Using output filename: ArchLinuxARM-sun4i-latest.tar.gz
  --2014-09-27 00:04:45--  http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-sun4i-latest.tar.gz
  Resolving os.archlinuxarm.org (os.archlinuxarm.org)... 142.4.223.96, 67.23.118.182, 54.203.244.41, ...
  Connecting to os.archlinuxarm.org (os.archlinuxarm.org)|142.4.223.96|:80... connected.
  HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable

      The file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.

  Checksum matched

Basic invocation syntax is ``wgets [ wget_opts ] url checksum``, checksum is
hex-decoded and hash func is auto-detected from its length (md5, sha-1, all
sha-2's are supported).

Idea is that - upon encountering an http link with either checksum on the page
or in the file nearby - you can easily run the thing providing both link and
checksum to fetch the file.

If checksum is available in e.g. \*.sha1 file alongside the original one, it
might be a good idea to fetch that checksum from any remote host (e.g. via
"curl" from any open ssh session), making spoofing of both checksum and the
original file a bit harder.

Things that manipulate whatever file contents.


znc log helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

znc-log-aggregator
''''''''''''''''''

Tool to process znc chat logs, produced by "log" module (global, per-user or
per-network - looks everywhere) and store them using following schema::

  <net>/chat/<channel>__<yy>-<mm>.log.xz
  <net>/priv/<nick>__<yy>-<mm>.log.xz

Where "priv" differs from "chat" in latter being prefixed by "#" or "&".
Values there are parsed according to any one of these (whichever matches
first):

* ``users/<net>/moddata/log/<chan>_<date>.log``

* ``moddata/log/<net>_default_<chan>_<date>.log`` (no "_" in ``<net>`` allowed)

* ``moddata/log/<user>_<net>_<chan>_<date>.log`` (no "_" in ``<user>`` or
  ``<net>`` allowed)

Each line gets processed by regexp to do ``[HH:MM:SS] <nick> some msg`` ->
``[yy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS] <nick> some msg``.

Latest (current day) logs are skipped. New logs for each run are concatenated to
the monthly .xz file.

Should be safe to stop at any time without any data loss - all the resulting
.xz's get written to temporary files and renamed at the very end (followed only
by unlinking of the source files).

All temp files are produced in the destination dir and should be cleaned-up on
any abort/exit/finish.

Idea is to have more convenient hierarchy and less files for easier shell
navigation/grepping (xzless/xzgrep), plus don't worry about the excessive space
usage in the long run.

znc-log-reader
''''''''''''''

Same as znc-log-aggregator above, but seeks/reads specific tail ("last n lines")
or time range (with additional filtering by channel/nick and network) from all
the current and aggregated logs.


others
^^^^^^

pysed
'''''

This one is for simple pcre-based text replacement, basically a sed's
"s/from/to/" command with lookahead/lookbehind assertions.

Example, to replace all two-space indents with tabs and drop space-based inline
alignment::

  % pysed '(?<=\w)\s+(?=\w)' ' ' '^\s*  ' '\t' -i10 -b somecode.py

pysort
''''''

Unlike tool from coreutils, can overwrite files with sorted results
(e.g. ``pysort -b file_a file_b && diff file_a file_b``) and has some options
for splitting fields and sorting by one of these (example: ``pysort -d: -f2 -n
/etc/passwd``).

repr
''''

Ever needed to check if file has newlines or BOM in it, yet every editor is
user-friendly by default and hides these from actual file contents?

One fix is hexdump or switching to binary mode, but these are usually terrible
for looking at text, and tend to display all non-ASCII as "." instead of nicer
\\r \\t \\n ... escapes, not to mention unicode chars.

This trivial script prints each line in a file via python3's repr(), which is
usually very nice, has none of the above issues and doesn't dump byte codes on
you for anything it can interpret as char/codepoint or some neat escape code.

Has opts for text/byte mode and stripping "universal newlines" (see newline= in
built-in open() func).

Can also do encoding/newline conversion via -c option, as iconv can't do BOM or
newlines, and sometimes you just want "MS utf-8 mode" (``repr -c utf-8-sig+r``).
Using that with +i flag as e.g. ``repr -c utf-8-sig+ri file1 file2 ...``
converts encoding+newlines+BOM for files in-place at no extra hassle.

color
'''''

Outputs terminal color sequences, making important output more distinctive.

Also can be used to interleave "tail -f" of several logfiles in the same
terminal::

  % t -f /var/log/app1.log | color red - &
  % t -f /var/log/app2.log | color green - &
  % t -f /var/log/app2.log | color blue - &

Or to get color-escape-magic for your bash script: ``color red bold p``

resolve-hostnames
'''''''''''''''''

Script (py3) to find all specified (either directly, or by regexp) hostnames and
replace these with corresponding IP addresses, resolved through getaddrinfo(3).

Examples::

  % cat cjdroute.conf
  ... "fraggod.net:21987": { ... },
      "localhost:21987": { ... },
      "fraggod.net:12345": { ... }, ...

  % resolve-hostnames fraggod.net localhost < cjdroute.conf
  ... "192.168.0.11:21987": { ... },
      "127.0.0.1:21987": { ... },
      "192.168.0.11:12345": { ... }, ...

  % resolve-hostnames -m '"(?P<name>[\w.]+):\d+"' < cjdroute.conf
  % resolve-hostnames fraggod.net:12345 < cjdroute.conf
  % resolve-hostnames -a inet6 fraggod.net localhost < cjdroute.conf
  ...

  % cat nftables.conf
  define set.gw.ipv4 = { !ipv4.name1.local, !ipv4.name2.local }
  define set.gw.ipv6 = { !ipv6.name1.local, !ipv6.name2.local }
  ...
  # Will crash nft-0.6 because it treats names in anonymous sets as AF_INET (ipv4 only)

  % resolve-hostnames -rum '!(\S+\.local)\b' -f nftables.conf
  define set.gw.ipv4 = { 10.12.34.1, 10.12.34.2 }
  define set.gw.ipv6 = { fd04::1, fd04::2 }
  ...

Useful a as conf-file pre-processor for tools that cannot handle names properly
(e.g. introduce ambiguity, can't deal with ipv4/ipv6, use weird resolvers, do it
dynamically, etc) or should not be allowed to handle these, convert lists of
names (in some arbitrary format) to IP addresses, and such.

Has all sorts of failure-handling and getaddrinfo-control cli options, can
resolve port/protocol names as well.

resolve-conf
''''''''''''

Python-3/Jinja2 script to produce a text file from a template, focused
specifically on templating configuration files, somewhat similar to
"resolve-hostnames" above or templating provided by ansible/saltstack.

Jinja2 env for template has following filters and values:

- ``dns(host [, af, proto, sock, default, force_unique=True])`` filter/global.

  getaddrinfo(3) wrapper to resolve ``host`` (name or address) with optional
  parameters to a single address, raising exception if it's non-unique by default.

  af/proto/sock values can be either enum value names (without AF/SOL/SOCK
  prefix) or integers.

- ``hosts`` - /etc/hosts as a mapping.

  For example, hosts-file line ``1.2.3.4 sub.host.example.org`` will produce
  following mapping (represented as yaml)::

    sub.host.example.org: 1.2.3.4
    host.example.org:
      sub: 1.2.3.4
    org:
      example:
        host:
          sub: 1.2.3.4

  | Can be used as a reliable dns/network-independent names.
  | ``--hosts-opts`` cli option allows some tweaks wrt how that file is parsed.

- ``iface`` - current network interfaces and IPv4/IPv6 addresses assigned there
  (fetched from libc getifaddrs via ctypes).

  Example value structure (as yaml)::

    enp1s0:
      - 10.0.0.134
      - fd00::134
      - 2001:470:1f0b:11de::134
      - fe80::c646:19ff:fe64:632f
    enp2s7:
      - 10.0.1.1
    lo:
      - 127.0.0.1
      - ::1
    ip_vti0: []

  Probably a good idea to use this stuff only when IPs are static and get
  assigned strictly before templating.

- ``{% comment_out_if value[, comment-prefix] %}...{% comment_out_end %}``

  Custom template block to prefix each non-empty line within it with specified
  string (defaults to "#") if value is not false-y.

  Can be used when format doesn't have block comments, but it's still desirable
  to keep disabled things in dst file (e.g. for manual tinkering) instead of
  using if-blocks around these, or to make specific lines easier to uncomment manually.

- ``it`` - itertools, ``_v``/``v_``/``_v_`` - global funcs for adding spaces
  before/after/around non-empty strings.

- Whatever is loaded from ``--conf-file/--conf-dir`` (JSON/YAML files), if specified.

Use-case is a simple conf-file pre-processor for autonomous templating on
service startup with a minimal toolbox on top of jinja2, without huge dep-tree
or any other requirements and complexity, that is not scary to run from
``ExecStartPre=`` line as root.

temp-patch
''''''''''

Tool to temporarily modify (patch) a file - until reboot or for a specified
amount of time. Uses bind-mounts from tmpfs to make sure file will be reverted
to the original state eventually.

Useful to e.g. patch ``/etc/hosts`` with (pre-defined) stuff from LAN on a
laptop (so this changes will be reverted on reboot), or a notification filter
file for a short "busy!" time period (with a time limit, so it'll auto-revert
after), or stuff like that.

Even though dst file is mounted with "-o ro" by default (there's "-w" option to
disable that), linux doesn't seem to care about that option and mounts the thing
as "rw" anyway, so "chmod a-w" gets run on temp file instead to prevent
accidental modification (that can be lost).

There're also "-t" and "-m" flags to control timestamps during the whole
process.

term-pipe
'''''''''

Disables terminal echo and outputs line-buffered stdin to stdout.

Use-case is grepping through huge multiline strings (e.g. webpage source) pasted
into terminal, i.e.::

  % term-pipe | g -o '\<http://[^"]\+'

  [pasting page here via e.g. Shift+Insert won't cause any echo]

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd
  http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.4/en/html/bug_page.html
  ...

There are better tools for that particular use-case, but this solution is
universal wrt any possible input source.

yaml-to-pretty-json
'''''''''''''''''''

Converts yaml files to an indented json, which is a bit more readable and
editable by hand than the usual compact one-liner serialization.

Due to yaml itself being json superset, can be used to convert json to
pretty-json as well.

hz
''

Same thing as the common "head" tool, but works with \\x00 (aka null character,
null byte, NUL, ␀, \\0, \\z, \\000, \\u0000, %00, ^@) delimeters.

Can be done with putting "tr" in the pipeline before and after "head", but this
one is probably less fugly.

Allows replacing input null-bytes with newlines in the output
(--replace-with-newlines option) and vice-versa.

Common use-case is probably has something to do with filenames and xargs, e.g.::

  % find -type f -print0 | shuf -z | hz -10 | xargs -0 some-cool-command
  % ls -1 | hz -z | xargs -0 some-other-command

I have "h" as an alias for "head" in shells, so "head -z" (if there were such
option) would be aliased neatly to "hz", hence the script name.

Defaults to reading ALL lines, not just arbitrary number (like 10, which is
default for regular "head")!

liac
''''

"Log Interleaver And Colorizer" python script.

.. figure:: http://blog.fraggod.net/images/liac_interleaved_colorized_output.jpg
   :alt: interleaved_and_colorized_output_image

Reads lines from multiple files, ordering them by the specified field in the
output (default - first field, e.g. ISO8601 timestamp) and outputs each with
(optional) unique-filename-part prefix and unique (ansi-terminal, per-file)
color.

Most useful for figuring out sequence of events from multiple timestamped logs.

To have safely-rotated logs with nice timestamps from any arbitrary command's
output, something like ``stdbuf -oL <command-and-args> | svlogd -r _ -ttt
<log-dir>`` can be used.
Note "stdbuf" coreutils tool, used there to tweak output buffering, which
usually breaks such timestamps, and "svlogd" from runit_ suite (no deps, can be
built separately).

See `blog post about liac tool`_ for more info.

.. _runit: http://smarden.org/runit/
.. _blog post about liac tool: http://blog.fraggod.net/2015/12/29/tool-to-interleave-and-colorize-lines-from-multiple-log-or-any-other-files.html

html-embed
''''''''''

Script to create "fat" HTML files, embedding all linked images
(as base64-encoded data-urls), stylesheets and js into them.

All src= and href= paths must be local (e.g. "js/script.js" or "/css/main.css"),
and will simply be treated as path components (stripping slashes on the left)
from html dir, nothing external (e.g. "//site.com/stuff.js") will be fetched.

Doesn't need anything but Python-3, based on stdlib html.parser module.

Not optimized for huge amounts of embedded data, storing all the substitutions
in memory while it runs, and is unsafe to run on random html files, as it can
embed something sensitive (e.g. ``<img src="../.ssh/id_rsa">``) - no extra
checks there.

Use-case is to easily produce single-file webapps or pages to pass around (or
share somewhere), e.g. some d3-based interactive chart page or an html report
with a few embedded images.

entropy
'''''''

Python (2 or 3) script to feed /dev/random linux entropy pool, to e.g. stop dumb
tools like gpg blocking forever on ``pacman --init`` in a throwaway chroot.

Basically haveged or rngd replacement for bare-bones chroots that don't have
either, but do have python.

Probably a bad idea to use it for anything other than very brief workarounds for
such tools on an isolated systems that don't run anything else crypto-related.

Shouldn't compromise deterministic stuff though, e.g. dm-crypt operation (except
new key generation in cryptsetup or such).



Misc
~~~~

systemd-dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python3 script to list all currently active and non-transient systemd units,
so that these can be tracked as a "system state",
and e.g. any deviations there detected/reported (simple diff can do it).

Gets unit info by parsing Dump() snapshot fetched via sd-bus API of libsystemd
(using ctypes to wrap it), which is same as e.g. "systemd-analyze dump" gets.

Has -m/--machines option to query state from all registered machines as well,
which requires root (for sd_bus_open_system_machine) due to current systemd limitations.

See `Dashboard-for-... blog post`_ for extended rationale,
though it's probably obsolete otherwise since this thing was rewritten.

.. _Dashboard-for-... blog post: http://blog.fraggod.net/2011/2/Dashboard-for-enabled-services-in-systemd

at
^^

Replacement for standard unix'ish "atd" daemon in the form of a bash script.

| It just forks out and waits for however long it needs before executing the given command.
| Unlike atd proper, such tasks won't survive reboot, obviously.

::

  Usage: ./at [ -h | -v ] when < sh_script
  With -v flag ./at mails script output if it's not empty even if exit code is zero.

mail
^^^^

Simple bash wrapper for sendmail command, generating From/Date headers and
stuff, just like mailx would do, but also allowing to pass custom headers
(useful for filtering error reports by-source), which some implementations of
"mail" fail to do.

passgen
^^^^^^^

Uses adict english dictionaly to generate easy-to-remember passphrase.  Should
be weak if bruteforce attack picks words instead of individual lettters.

ssh-tunnel
^^^^^^^^^^

| Script to keep persistent, unique and reasonably responsive ssh tunnels.
| Mostly just a bash wrapper with collection of options for such use-case.
|

I.e. to run ``ssh-tunnel -ti 60 2223:nexthop:22 user@host -p2222`` instead of
some manual loop (re-)connecting every 60s in the background using something like::

  ssh \
    -oControlPath=none -oControlMaster=no \
    -oConnectTimeout=5 -oServerAliveInterval=3 -oServerAliveCountMax=5 \
    -oPasswordAuthentication=no -oNumberOfPasswordPrompts=0 \
    -oBatchMode=yes -oExitOnForwardFailure=yes -TnNqy \
    -p2222 -L 2223:nexthop:22 user@host

Which are all pretty much required for proper background tunnel operation.

| Has opts for reverse-tunnels and using tping tool instead of ssh/sleep loop.
| Keeps pidfiles in /tmp and allows to kill running tunnel-script via same command with -k/kill appended.

ssh-reverse-mux-\*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3.6+ (asyncio) scripts to establish multiple ssh reverse-port-forwarding
("ssh -R") connections to the same tunnel-server from mutliple hosts using same
exact configuration on each.

Normally, first client host will bind the "ssh -R" listening port and all others
will fail, but these two scripts negotiate unique port within specified range to
each host, so there are no clashes and all tunnels work fine.

Tunnel server also stores allocated ports in a db file, so that each client gets
more-or-less persistent listening port.

Each client negotiates port before exec'ing "ssh -R" command, identifying itself
via --ident-* string (derived from /etc/machine-id by default), and both
client/server need to use same -s/--auth-secret to create/validate MACs in each
packet.

mosh-nat / mosh-nat-bind.c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python (3.6+) wrapper for mosh-server binary to do UDP hole punching through
local NAT setup before starting it.

Comes with mosh-nat-bind.c source for LD_PRELOAD=./mnb.so lib to force
mosh-client on the other side to use specific local port that was used in
"mosh-nat".

Example usage (server at 84.217.173.225, client at 74.59.38.152)::

  server% ./mosh-nat 74.59.38.152
  mosh-client command:
    MNB_PORT=34730 LD_PRELOAD=./mnb.so

    MOSH_KEY=rYt2QFJapgKN5GUqKJH2NQ mosh-client 84.217.173.225 34730

Notes:

- mnb.so is mosh-nat-bind.c lib. Check its header for command to build it.
- Both mnb.so and mosh-nat only work with IPv4, IPv6 shouldn't use NAT anyway.
- Should only work like that when NAT on either side doesn't rewrite src ports.
- 34730 is default for -c/--client-port and -s/--server-port opts.
- Started mosh-server waits for 60s (default) for mosh-client to connect.
- Continous operation relies on mosh keepalive packets without interruption.
- No roaming of any kind is possible here.
- New MOSH_KEY is generated by mosh-server on every run.

Useful for direct and fast connection when there's some other means of access
available already, e.g. ssh through some slow/indirect tunnel or port forwarding
setup.

urlparse
^^^^^^^^

Simple script to parse long URL with lots of parameters, decode and print it out
in an easily readable ordered YAML format or diff (that is, just using "diff"
command on two outputs) with another URL.

No more squinting at some huge incomprehensible ecommerce URLs before scraping
the hell out of them!

openssl-fingerprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do ``openssl s_client -connect somesite </dev/null | openssl
x509 -fingerprint -noout -sha1`` in a nicer way - openssl cli tool doesn't seem
to have that.

Also can be passed socks proxy IP:PORT to use socat and pipe openssl connection
through it - for example, to get fingerprint over Tor (with ``SocksAddress
localhost:1080``) link::

  % openssl-fingerprint google.com localhost:1080
  SHA1 Fingerprint=A8:7A:93:13:23:2E:97:4A:08:83:DD:09:C4:5F:37:D5:B7:4E:E2:D4

graphite-scratchpad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tool to load/dump stored graphite_ graphs through formats easily editable by
hand.

For example, creating even one dashboard there is a lot of clicky-clicks, and 10
slightly different dashboards is mission impossible, but do
``graphite-scratchpad dash:top`` (loaded straight from graphite db) and you
get::

  name: top

  defaultGraphParams:
    from: -24hours
    height: 250
    until: -20minutes
    width: 400

  ...

  graphs:
    - target:
        - *.memory.allocation.reclaimable
    - target:
        - *.disk.load.sdb.utilization
        - *.disk.load.sda.utilization
      yMax: 100
      yMin: 0
    - target:
        - *.cpu.all.idle
      yMax: 100
      yMin: 0
  ...

That's all graph-building data in an easily readable, editable and parseable
format (yaml, nicely-spaced with pyaml_ module).

Edit that and do ``graphite-scratchpad yaml dash:top < dash.yaml`` to replace
the thing in graphite db with an updated thing. Much easier than doing anything
with GUI.

ip-ext
^^^^^^

Some minor tools for network configuration from console/scripts, which iproute2
seem to be lacking, in a py3 script.

For instance, if network interface on a remote machine was (mis-)configured in
initramfs or wherever to not have link-local IPv6 address, there seem to be no
tool to restore it without whole "ip link down && ip link up" dance, which can
be a bad idea.

``ipv6-lladdr`` subcommand handles that particular case, generating ipv6-lladdr
from mac, as per RFC 4291 (as implemented in "netaddr" module) and can assign
resulting address to the interface, if missing:

.. code:: console

  # ip-ext --debug ipv6-lladdr -i enp0s9 -x
  DEBUG:root:Got lladdr from interface (enp0s9): 00:e0:4c:c2:78:86
  DEBUG:root:Assigned ipv6_lladdr (fe80::2e0:4cff:fec2:7886) to interface: enp0s9

``ipv6-dns`` tool generates \*.ip.arpa and djbdns records for specified IPv6.

``ip-check`` subcommand allows to check if address (ipv4/ipv6) is assigned to
any of the interfaces and/or run "ip add" (with specified parameters) to assign
it, if not.

``iptables-flush`` removes all iptables/ip6tables rules from all tables,
including any custom chains, using iptables-save/restore command-line tools, and
sets policy for default chains to ACCEPT.

hype
^^^^

Tools to work with cjdns_ and Hyperboria_ stuff.

Has lots of subcommands for cjdns admin interface interaction, various related
data processing, manipulation (ipv6, public key, switchLabel, config file, etc)
and obfuscation. Full list with descriptions and all possible options is
in --help output.

Some of the functionality bits are described below.

decode-path
'''''''''''

Decode cjdns "Path" to a sequence of integer "peer indexes", one for each hop.

Relies on encoding schema described in NumberCompress.h of cjdns. Nodes are not
required to use it in theory, and there are other encoding schemas implemented
which should break this tool's operation, but in practice no one bothers to
change that default.

Examples:

* ``hype decode-path 0000.013c.bed9.5363 -> 3 54 42 54 15 5 30``
* ``hype decode-path -x 0ff9.e22d.6cb5.19e3 -> 03 1e 03 6a 32 0b 16 62 03 0f 0f``

conf-paste
''''''''''

Obfuscates cjdns config file (cjdroute.conf) in a secure and (optionally)
deterministic way.

Should be useful to pastebin your config file without revealing most sensitive
data (passwords and keys) in it. Might still reveal some peer info like IP
endpoints, contacts, comments, general list of nodes you're peered with. Use
with caution.

Sensitive bits are regexp-matched (by their key) and then value is processed
through pbkdf2-sha256 and output is truncated to appear less massive. pbkdf2
parameters are configurable (see --help output), and at least --pbkdf2-salt
should be passed for output to be deterministic, otherwise random salt value
will be used.

peers
'''''

Shows peer stats, with some extra info, like ipv6'es derived from keys (--raw to
disable all that).

peers-remote
''''''''''''

Shows a list of peers (with pubkeys, ipv6'es, paths, etc) for any remote node,
specified by its ipv6, path, pubkey or addr, resolving these via
SearchRunner_search as necessary.

ipv6-to-record, key-to-ipv6
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Misc pubkey/ipv6 representation/conversion helpers.

.. _cjdns: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/
.. _Hyperboria: http://hyperboria.net/

adhocapd
^^^^^^^^

Picks first wireless dev from ``iw dev`` and runs hostapd_ + udhcpd (from
busybox) on it.

Use-case is plugging wifi usb dongle and creating temporary AP on it - kinda
like "tethering" functionality in Android and such.

Configuration for both is generated using reasonable defaults - distinctive
(picked from ``ssid_list`` at the top of the script) AP name and random password
(using ``passgen`` from this repo or falling back to ``tr -cd '[:alnum:]'
</dev/urandom | head -c10``).

Dev, ssid, password, ip range and such can also be specified on the command line
(see --help).

If inet access thru local machine is needed, don't forget to also do something
like this (with default ip range of 10.67.35.0/24 and "wlp0s18f2u2" interface
name)::

  # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
  # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.67.35.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
  # iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.67.35.0/24 -i wlp0s18f2u2 -j ACCEPT
  # iptables -A FORWARD -d 10.67.35.0/24 -o wlp0s18f2u2 -j ACCEPT

These rules are also echoed in the script, with IP and interface name that was
used.

For consistent naming of network interfaces from usb devices (to e.g.  have
constant set of firewall rules for these), following udev rule can be used (all
usb-wlan interfaces will be named according to NAME there)::

  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="wlan",\
    DEVPATH=="*/usb[0-9]/*", NAME="wlan_usb"

wpa-systemd-wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Systemd wrapper for `wpa_supplicant`_ or hostapd_, enabling either to work with
Type=notify, support WatchdogSec=, different exit codes and all that goodness.

Starts the daemon as a subprocess, connecting to its management interface and
watching state/wpa_state changes, only indicating "started" state for systemd
when daemon actually starts scanning/connecting (for wpa_supplicant) or sets
state=enabled for hostapd.

WatchdogSec= issues PING commands to underlying daemon, proxying responses back,
as long as daemon state is somehting valid, and not INTERFACE-DISABLED,
locally-generated disconnect or such, usually indicating hw failure, kernel
module issue or whatever else.

Such thing is needed to have systemd unit state follow AP/STA state, failing
when e.g. wifi dongle gets pulled out from USB port, as that doesn't actually
cause these things to fail/exit otherwise, which might be desirable if that wifi
link is critical to other services or as a reboot-workaround for driver bugs.

Example systemd unit (AP mode)::

  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/wpa-systemd-wrapper \
    --exit-check '/run/wpa.wlan0.first-run:config' \
    --ap-mode wlan0 /etc/hostapd.wlan0.conf

  Type=notify
  WatchdogSec=90
  Restart=on-failure
  RestartPreventExitStatus=78
  RestartSec=3
  # StartLimitInterval=8min
  # StartLimitBurst=10
  # StartLimitAction=reboot

This will run hostapd (due to -a/--ap-mode), and exit with special 78/CONFIG
code if "first-run" file exists and hostapd never gets into ENABLED state on the
first attempt - i.e. something likely wrong with the config and there's no point
restarting it ad nauseum.

Python3/asyncio, requires python-systemd installed, use -h/--help and -d/--debug
opts for more info.

mikrotik-backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script to ssh into `mikrotik <http://mikrotik.com>`_ routers with really old
DSA-only firmware via specified ("--auth-file" option) user/password and get the
backup, optionally compressing it.

| Can determine address of the router on its own (using "ip route get").
| Can be used more generally to get/store output of any command(s) to the router.
| Python script, uses "twisted.conch" for ssh.
|

Should not be used with modern firmware, where using e.g. ``ssh admin@router
/export`` with RSA keys works perfectly well.

"backup/ssh-dump" script from this repo can be used to pass all necessary
non-interactive mode options and compress/rotate resulting file with these.

kernel-patch
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple stateless script to update sources in /usr/src/linux to some (specified)
stable version.

Looks for "patch-X.Y.Z.xz" files (as provided on kernel.org) under
/usr/src/distfiles (configurable at the top of the script), or downloads them
there from kernel.org.

Does update (or rollback) by grabbing current patchset version from Makefile and
doing essentially ``patch -R < <patch-current> && patch < <patch-new>`` - i.e.
rolling-back the current patchset, then applying new patch.

Always does ``patch --dry-run`` first to make sure there will be no mess left
over by the tool and updates will be all-or-nothing.

In short, allows to run e.g. ``kernel-patch 3.14.22`` to get 3.14.22 in
``/usr/src/linux`` from any other clean 3.14.\* version, or just
``kernel-patch`` to have the latest 3.14 patchset.

kernel-conf-check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ad-hoc python3 script to check any random snippet with linux kernel
``CONFIG_...`` values (e.g. "this is stuff you want to set" block on some wiki)
against kernel config file, current config in /proc/config.gz or such.

Reports what matches and what doesn't to stdout, trivial regexp matching.

blinky
^^^^^^

Script to blink gpio-connected leds via ``/sys/class/gpio`` interface.

Includes oneshot mode, countdown mode (with some interval scaling option),
direct on-off phase delay control (see --pre, --post and --interval\* options),
cooperation between several instances using same gpio pin, "until" timestamp
spec, and generally everything I can think of being useful (mostly for use from
other scripts though).

systemd-watchdog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trivial script to ping systemd watchdog and do some trivial actions in-between
to make sure os still works.

Wrote it after yet another silent non-crash, where linux kernel refuses to
create new pids (with some backtraces) and seem to hang on some fs ops, blocking
syslog/journal, but leaving most simple daemons running ok-ish for a while.

So this trivial script, tied into systemd-controlled watchdog timers, tries to
create pids every once in a while, with either hang or crash bubbling-up to
systemd (pid-1), which should reliably reboot/crash the system via hardware wdt.

Example watchdog.service::

  [Service]
  Type=notify
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/systemd-watchdog -i30 -n \
    -f /var/log/wdt-fail.log \
    -x 'ip link' -x 'ip addr' -x 'ip ro' -x 'journalctl -an30'

  WatchdogSec=60
  TimeoutStartSec=15
  Restart=on-failure
  RestartSec=20
  StartLimitInterval=10min
  StartLimitBurst=5
  StartLimitAction=reboot-force

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

(be sure to tweak timeouts and test without "reboot-force" first though,
e.g. pick RestartSec= for transient failures to not trigger StartLimitAction)

Can optionally get IP of (non-local) gateway to 1.1.1.1 (or any specified IPv4)
via libmnl (also used by iproute2, so always available) and check whether it
responds to `fping <http://fping.org/>`_ probes, crashing if it does not - see
-n/--check-net-gw option.

That's mainly for remote systems which can become unreachable if kernel network
stack, local firewall, dhcp, ethernet or whatever other link fails (usually due
to some kind of local tinkering), ignoring more mundane internet failures.

To avoid reboot loops (in abscence of any networking), it might be a good idea
to only start script with this option manually (e.g. right before messing up
with the network, or on first successful access).

-f/--fail-log option is to log date/time of any failures for latest boot
and run -x/--fail-log-cmd command(s) on any python exceptions (note: kernel
hangs probably won't cause these), logging their stdout/stderr there -
e.g. to dump network configuration info as in example above.

Useless without systemd and requires systemd python3 module, plus fping tool if
-n/--check-net-gw option is used.

bt-pan
^^^^^^

Note: you might want to look at "bneptest" tool that comes with bluez - might be
a good replacement for this script, which I haven't seen at the moment of its
writing (maybe wasn't there, maybe just missed it).

Bluetooth Personal Area Network (PAN) client/server setup script.

BlueZ does all the work here, script just sends it commands to enable/register
appropriate services.

Can probably be done with one of the shipped tools, but I haven't found it, and
there's just too many of them to remember anyway.

::

  machine-1 # ./bt-pan --debug server bnep
  machine-2 # ./bt-pan --debug client <machine-1-bdaddr>

First line above will probably complain that "bnep" bridge is missing and list
commands to bring it up (brctl, ip).

Default mode for both "server" and "client" is NAP (AP mode, like with WiFi).

Both commands make bluetoothd (that should be running) create "bnepX" network
interfaces, connected to server/clients, and "server" also automatically (as
clients are connecting) adds these to specified bridge.

Not sure how PANU and GN "ad-hoc" modes are supposed to work - both BlueZ
"NetworkServer" and "Network" (client) interfaces support these, so I suppose
one might need to run both or either of server/client commands (with e.g. "-u
panu" option).

Couldn't get either one of ad-hoc modes to work myself, but didn't try
particulary hard, and it might be hardware issue as well, I guess.

ssh-fingerprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ssh-keyscan, but outputting each key in every possible format.

Imagine you have an incoming IM message "hey, someone haxxors me, it says 'ECDSA
key fingerprint is f5:e5:f9:b6:a4:6b:fd:b3:07:15:f6:d9:0c:f5:47:54', what do?",
this tool allows to dump any such fingerprint for a remote host, with::

  % ssh-fingerprint congo.fg.nym
  ...
  congo.fg.nym ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNo...zoU04g=
  256 MD5:f5:e5:f9:b6:a4:6b:fd:b3:07:15:f6:d9:0c:f5:47:54 /tmp/.ssh_keyscan.key.kc3ur3C (ECDSA)
  256 SHA256:lFLzFQR...2ZBmIgQi/w /tmp/.ssh_keyscan.key.kc3ur3C (ECDSA)
  ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
  ...

Only way I know how to get that
"f5:e5:f9:b6:a4:6b:fd:b3:07:15:f6:d9:0c:f5:47:54" secret-sauce is to either do
your own md5 + hexdigest on ssh-keyscan output (and not mess-up due to some
extra space or newline), or store one of the keys from there with first field
cut off into a file and run ``ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key.pub``.

Note how "intuitive" it is to confirm something that ssh prints (and it prints
only that md5-fp thing!) for every new host you connect to with just openssh.

With this command, just running it on the remote host - presumably from diff
location, or even localhost - should give (hopefully) any possible gibberish
permutation that openssh (or something else) may decide to throw at you.

ssh-keyparse
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tool to extract raw private key string from ed25519 ssh keys.

Main purpose is easy backup of ssh private keys and derivation of new secrets
from these for other purposes.

For example::

  % ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f test-key
  ...

  % cat test-key
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
  QyNTUxOQAAACDaKUyc/3dnDL+FS4/32JFsF88oQoYb2lU0QYtLgOx+yAAAAJi1Bt0atQbd
  GgAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACDaKUyc/3dnDL+FS4/32JFsF88oQoYb2lU0QYtLgOx+yA
  AAAEAc5IRaYYm2Ss4E65MYY4VewwiwyqWdBNYAZxEhZe9GpNopTJz/d2cMv4VLj/fYkWwX
  zyhChhvaVTRBi0uA7H7IAAAAE2ZyYWdnb2RAbWFsZWRpY3Rpb24BAg==
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

  % ssh-keyparse test-key
  HOSEWmGJtkrOBOuTGGOFXsMIsMqlnQTWAGcRIWXvRqQ=

That one line at the end contains 32-byte ed25519 seed (with urlsafe-base64
encoding) - "secret key" - all the necessary info to restore the blob above,
without extra openssh wrapping (as per PROTOCOL.key).

Original OpenSSH format (as produced by ssh-keygen) stores "magic string",
ciphername ("none"), kdfname ("none"), kdfoptions (empty string), public key and
index for that, two "checkint" numbers, seed + public key string, comment and a
bunch of extra padding at the end. All string values there are length-prefixed,
so take extra 4 bytes, even when empty.

Gist is that it's a ton of stuff that's not the actual key, which ssh-keyparse
extracts.

To restore key from seed, use -d/--patch-key option on any existing ed25519 key,
e.g. ``ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f test-key && ssh-keyparse -d <seed> test-key``

If key is encrypted with passphrase, ``ssh-keygen -p`` will be run on a
temporary copy of it to decrypt, with a big warning in case it's not desirable.

There's also an option (--pbkdf2) to run the thing through PBKDF2 (tunable via
--pbkdf2-opts) and various output encodings available::

  % ssh-keyparse test-key  # default is urlsafe-base64 encoding
  HOSEWmGJtkrOBOuTGGOFXsMIsMqlnQTWAGcRIWXvRqQ=

  % ssh-keyparse test-key --hex
  1ce4845a6189b64ace04eb931863855ec308b0caa59d04d60067112165ef46a4

  % ssh-keyparse test-key --base32
  3KJ8-8PK1-H6V4-NKG4-XE9H-GRW5-BV1G-HC6A-MPEG-9NG0-CW8J-2SFF-8TJ0-e

  % ssh-keyparse test-key --base32-nodashes
  3KJ88PK1H6V4NKG4XE9HGRW5BV1GHC6AMPEG9NG0CW8J2SFF8TJ0e

  % ssh-keyparse test-key --raw >test-key.bin

With encoding like --base32 (`Douglas Crockford's human-oriented Base32`_, last
lowercase letter there is a checksum), it's easy to even read the thing over
voice-comm link, if necessary.

.. _Douglas Crockford's human-oriented Base32: http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html

ssh-key-init
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bash script to generate (init) ssh key (via ssh-keygen) without asking about
various legacy and uninteresting options and safe against replacing existing
keys.

I.e. don't ever want RSA, ECDSA or such nonsense (Ed25519 is the norm), don't
need passwords for 99.999% of the keys, don't care about any of the ssh-keygen
output, don't need any interactivity, but do care about silently overwriting
existing key and want the thing to create parent dirs properly (which -f fails
to do).

Has -m option to init key for an nspawn container under ``/var/lib/machines``
(e.g. ``ssh-key-init -m mymachine``) and -r option to replace any existing keys.
Sets uid/gid of the parent path for all new ones and -m700.

rrd-sensors-logger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Daemon script to grab data from whatever sensors and log it all via rrdtool.

Self-contained, configurable, handles clock jumps and weirdness (for e.g. arm
boards that lack battery-backed RTC), integrates with systemd (Type=notify,
watchdog), has commands to easily produce graphs from this data (and can serve
these via http), print last values.

Auto-generates rrd schema from config (and filename from that), inits db, checks
for time jumps and aborts if necessary (rrdtool can't handle these, and they are
common on arm boards), cleans up after itself.

Same things can be done by using rrdtool directly, but it requires a ton of
typing for graph options and such, while this script generates it all for you,
and is designed to be "hands-off" kind of easy.

Using it to keep track of SoC sensor readings on boards like RPi (to see if
maybe it's time to cram a heatsink on top of one or something), for more serious
systems something like collectd + graphite might be a better option.

Command-line usage::

  % rrd-sensors-logger daemon --http-listen --http-opts-allow &

  % rrd-sensors-logger print-conf-example
  ### rrd-sensors-logger configuration file (format: YAML)
  ### Place this file into ~/.rrd-sensors-logger.yaml or specify explicitly with --conf option.
  ...

  % rrd-sensors-logger print-last
  cpu.t: 30.22513627594576
  gpu.t: 39.44316309653439
  mb_1.t: 41.77566666851852
  mb_2.t: 41.27842380952381

  % curl -o graph.png http://localhost:8123/
  % curl -o graph.png http://localhost:8123/t
  % curl -o graph.png 'http://localhost:8123/t/width:+1900,height:+800'
  % curl -o graph.png 'http://localhost:8123//start:+-2d,logarithmic:+true,title:+my+graph'

  % feh $(rrd-sensors-logger graph t -o 'start: -3h')

See top of the script for yaml config (also available via "print-conf-example")
and systemd unit file example ("print-systemd-unit" command).

Uses: layered-yaml-attrdict-config (lya), rrdtool.

nsh
^^^

Bash script to "nsenter" into specified machine's (as can be seen in ``ps -eo
machine`` or ``nsh`` when run without args) container namespaces and run login
shell there.

Machine in question must run systemd as pid-1 (e.g. systemd-nspawn container),
as it gets picked as --target pid for nsenter.

Very similar to ``machinectl login <machine>``, but does not asks for
user/password and does not start new "systemd --user" session, just runs
``su -`` to get root login shell.

Essentially same as ``machinectl shell <machine>``, but doesn't require
systemd-225 and machine being registered with systemd at all.

If running ``tty`` there says ``not a tty`` and e.g. ``screen`` bails out with
``Must be connected to a terminal.``, just run extra ``getty tty`` there - will
ask to login (be mindful of /etc/securetty if login fails), and everything
tty-related should work fine afterwards.

If run without argument or with -l/--list option, will list running machines.

See also: lsns(1), nsenter(1), unshare(1)

ssh-tunnels-cleanup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bash script to list or kill users' sshd pids, created for "ssh -R" tunnels, that
don't have a listening socket associated with them or don't show ssh protocol
greeting (e.g. "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4") there.

These seem to occur when ssh client suddenly dies and reconnects to create new
tunnel - old pid can still hog listening socket (even though there's nothing on
the other end), but new pid won't exit and hang around uselessly.

Solution is to a) check for sshd pids that don't have listenings socket, and
b) connect to sshd pids' sockets and see if anything responds there, killing
both non-listening and unresponsive pids.

Only picks sshd pids for users with specific prefix, e.g. "tun-" by default, to
be sure not to kill anything useful (i.e. anything that's not for "ssh -R").

Uses ps, ss, gawk and ncat (comes with nmap), only prints pids by default
(without -k/--kill option).

Also has -s/--cleanup-sessions option to remove all "abandoned" login sessions
(think loginctl) for user with specified prefix, i.e. any leftover stuff after
killing those useless ssh pids.

See also: `autossh <http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/>`_ and such.

pam-run
^^^^^^^

Wrapper that opens specified PAM session (as per one of the configs in
``/etc/pam.d``, e.g. "system-login"), switches to specified uid/gid and runs
some command there.

My use-case is to emulate proper "login" session for systemd-logind, which
neither "su" nor "sudo" can do (nor should do!) in default pam configurations
for them, as they don't load pam_systemd.so (as opposed to something like
``machinectl shell myuser@ -- ...``).

This script can load any pam stack however, so e.g. running it as::

  # pam-run -s system-login -u myuser -t :1 \
    -- bash -c 'systemctl --user import-environment \
      && systemctl --user start xorg.target && sleep infinity'

Should initiate proper systemd-logind session (and close it afterwards) and
start "xorg.target" in "myuser"-specific "systemd --user" instance (started by
logind with the session).

Can be used as a GDM-less way to start/keep such sessions (with proper
display/tty and class/type from env) without much hassle or other weirdness like
"agetty --autologin" or "login" in some pty (see also `mk-fg/de-setup
<https://github.com/mk-fg/de-setup>`_ repo), or for whatever other pam wrapping
or testing (e.g. try logins with passwords from file), as it has nothing
specific (or even related) to desktops.

Self-contained python-3 script, using libpam via ctypes.

Warning: this script is no replacement for su/sudo wrt uid/gid-switching, and
doesn't implement all the checks and sanitization these tools do, so only
intended to be run from static, clean or trusted environment (e.g. started by
systemd or manually).

tping
^^^^^

Python-3 (asyncio) tool to try connecting to specified TCP port until connection
can be established, then just exit, i.e. to wait until some remote port is accessible.

Can be used to wait for host to reboot before trying to ssh into it, e.g.::

  % tping myhost && ssh root@myhost

(default -p/--port is 22 - ssh)

Tries establishing new connection (forcing new SYN, IPv4/IPv6 should both work)
every -r/--retry-delay seconds (default: 1), only discarding (closing) "in
progress" connections after -t/--timeout seconds (default: 3), essentially
keeping rotating pool of establishing connections until one of them succeeds.

This means that with e.g. ``-r1 -t5`` there will be 5 establishing connections
(to account for slow-to-respond remote hosts) rotating every second, so ratio of
these delays shouldn't be too high to avoid spawning too many connections.

Host/port names specified on the command line are resolved synchronously on
script startup (same as with e.g. "ping" tool), so it can't be used to wait
until hostname resolves, only for connection itself.

Above example can also be shortened via -s/--ssh option, e.g.::

  % tping -s myhost 1234
  % tping -s root@myhost:1234 # same thing as above
  % tping -s -p1234 myhost # same thing as above

Will exec ``ssh -p1234 root@myhost`` immediately after successful tcp connection.

Uses python3 stdlib stuff, namely asyncio, to juggle multiple connections in an
efficient manner.

bindfs-idmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`bindfs <http://bindfs.org/>`_ wrapper script to setup id-mapping from uid of
the mountpoint to uid/gid of the source directory.

I.e. after ``bindfs-idmap /var/lib/machines/home/src-user ~dst-user/tmp``,
``~dst-user/tmp`` will be accessible to dst-user as if they were src-user, with
all operations proxied to src-user's dir.

Anything created under ``~dst-user/tmp`` will have uid/gid of the src dir.

Useful to allow temporary access to some uid's files in a local container to
user acc in a main namespace.

For long-term access (e.g. for some daemon), there probably are better options
than such bindfs hack - e.g. bind-mounts, shared uids/gids, ACLs, etc.

patch-nspawn-ids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python3 script to "shift" or "patch" uid/gid values with new container-id
according to systemd-nspawn schema, i.e. set upper 16-bit to specified
container-id value and keep lower 16 bits to uid/gid inside the container.

Similar operation to what systemd-nspawn's --private-users-chown option does
(described in nspawn-patch-uid.c), but standalone, doesn't bother with ACLs or
checks on filesystem boundaries.

Main purpose is to update uids when migrating systemd-nspawn containers or
adding paths/filesystems to these without clobbering ownership info there.

Should be safe to use anywhere, as in most non-nspawn cases upper bits of
uid/gid are always zero, hence any changes can be easily reverted by running
this tool again with -c0.

primes
^^^^^^

Python3 script to print prime numbers in specified range.

For small ranges only, as it does brute-force [2, sqrt(n)] division checks,
and intended to generate primes for non-overlapping "tick % n" workload spacing,
not any kind of crypto operations.

boot-patcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Py3 script to run on early boot, checking specific directory for update-files
and unpack/run these, recording names to skip applied ones on subsequent boots.

Idea for it is to be very simple, straightforward, single-file drop-in script to
put on distributed .img files to avoid re-making these on every one-liner change,
sending tiny .update files instead.

Update-file format:

- Either zip or bash script with .update suffix.
- Script/zip detected by python's zipfile.is_zipfile() (zip file magic).
- If zip, should contain "_install" (update-install) script inside.
- Update-install script shebang is optional, defaults to "#!/bin/bash".

Update-install script env:

- BP_UPDATE_ID: name of the update (without .update suffix, e.g. "001.test").

- BP_UPDATE_DIR: unpacked update zip dir in tmpfs.

  Will only have "_install" file in it for standalone scripts (non-zip).

- BP_UPDATE_STATE: /var/lib/boot-patcher/<update-id>

  Persistent dir created for this update, can be used to backup various
  updated/removed files, just in case.

  If left empty, removed after update-install script is done.

- BP_UPDATE_STATE_ROOT: /var/lib/boot-patcher

- BP_UPDATE_REBOOT: reboot-after flag-file (on tmpfs) to touch.

  | If reboot is required after this update, create (touch) file at that path.
  | Reboot will be done immediately after this particular update, not after all of them.

- BP_UPDATE_REAPPLY: flag-file (on tmpfs) to re-run this update on next boot.

  Can be used to retry failed updates by e.g. creating it at the start of the
  script and removing on success.

Example update-file contents:

- 2017-10-27.001.install-stuff.zip.update

  ``_install``::

    cd "$BP_UPDATE_DIR"
    exec pacman --noconfirm -U *.pkg.tar.xz

  ``*.pkg.tar.xz`` - any packages to install, zipped alongside that ^^^

  ``*.patch`` - patches for "app" from the repo, made by e.g. ``git format-patch -3``.

Misc notes:

- Update-install exit code is not checked.

- After update-install is finished, and if BP_UPDATE_REAPPLY was not created,
  "<update-id>.done" file is created in BP_UPDATE_STATE_ROOT and update is
  skipped on all subsequent runs.

- Update ordering is simple alphasort, dependenciess can be checked by update
  scripts via .done files (also mentioned in prev item).

- No auth (e.g. signature checks) for update-files, so be sure to send these
  over secure channels.

- Run as ``boot-patcher --print-systemd-unit`` for the only bit of setup it needs.



dev
~~~

Minor things I tend to use when writing code and stuff.

tabs_filter
^^^^^^^^^^^

My secret weapon in tabs-vs-spaces holywar.

In my emacs, tab key always inserts "", marking spaces as a bug with
develock-mode. This script transparently converts all indent-tabs into spaces
and back, designed to be used from git content filters, and occasionally by
hand.

.git/config::

  [filter "tabs"]
    clean = tabs_filter clean %f
    smudge = tabs_filter smudge %f

.git/info/attributes or .gitattributes::

  *.py filter=tabs
  *.tac filter=tabs

Not sure why people have such strong opinions on that trivial matter,
but I find it easier never to mention that I use such script ;)

golang_filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same idea as in "tabs_filter", but on a larger scale - basically does to Go_
what coffee-script_ does to the syntax of javascript - drops all the unnecessary
brace-cancer, with the ability to restore original perfectly ("diff -u reverse
original" is checked upon transformation to make sure of that), as long as code
intentation is correct.

.. _Go: http://golang.org/
.. _coffee-script: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/

.git/config::

  [filter "golang"]
    clean = golang_filter git-clean %f
    smudge = golang_filter git-smudge %f

.git/info/attributes or .gitattributes::

  *.go filter=golang

Again, ideally no one should even notice that I actually don't have that crap in
the editor, while repo and compiler will see the proper (bloated) code.

distribute_regen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tool to auto-update python package metadata in setup.py and README files.

Uses python ast module to parse setup.py to find "version" keyword there and
update it (via simple regex replacement, not sure if ast can be converted back
to code properly), based on date and current git revision number, producing
something like "12.04.58" (year.month.revision-since-month-start).

Also generates (and checks with docutils afterwards) README.txt (ReST) from
README.md (Markdown) with pandoc, if both are present and there's no README or
README.rst.

Designed to be used from pre-commit hook, like ``ln -s /path/to/distribute_regen
.git/hooks/pre-commit``, to update version number before every commit.

darcs_bundle_to_diff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ad-hoc tool to dissect and convert darcs bundles into a sequence of unified diff
hunks. Handles file creations and all sorts of updates, but probably not moves
and removals, which were outside my use-case at the moment.

Was written for just one occasion (re-working old bundles attached to tahoe-lafs
tickets, which crashed darcs on "darcs apply"), so might be incomplete and a bit
out-of-date, but I imagine it shouldn't take much effort to make it work with
any other bundles.

git-nym
^^^^^^^

Script to read NYM env var and run git using that ssh id instead of whatever
ssh-agent or e.g. ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` provides.

NYM var is checked for either full path to the key, basename in ``~/.ssh``, name
like ``~/.ssh/id_{rsa,ecdsa,ed25519}__${NYM}`` or unique (i.e. two matches will
cause error, not random pick) match for one of ``~/.ssh/id_*`` name part.

Can be used as ``NYM=project-x git-nym clone git@dev.project-x:component-y`` to
e.g.  clone the specified repo using ``~/.ssh/id_rsa__project-x`` key or as
``NYM=project-x git nym clone ...``.

Also to just test new keys with git, disregarding ssh-agent and lingering
control sockets with NYM_CLEAN flag set.

git-meld
^^^^^^^^

Git-command replacement for git-diff to run meld instead of regular
(git-provided) textual diff, but aggregating all the files into one invocation.

For instance, if diffs are in ``server.py`` and ``client.py`` files, running
``git meld`` will run something like::

  meld \
    --diff /tmp/.git-meld/server.py.hash1 /tmp/.git-meld/server.py.hash2 \
    --diff /tmp/.git-meld/client.py.hash1 /tmp/.git-meld/client.py.hash2

Point is to have all these diffs in meld tabs (with one window per ``git meld``)
instead of running separate meld window/tab on each pair of files as setting
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF would do.

Should be installed as ``git-meld`` somewhere in PATH *and* symlinked as
``meld-git`` (git-meld runs ``GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=meld-git git diff "$@"``) to
work.

catn
^^^^

Similar to "cat" (specifically coreutils' ``cat -n file``), but shows specific
line in a file with a few "context" lines around it::

  % catn js/main.js 188
     185:     projectionTween = function(projection0, projection1) {
     186:       return function(d) {
     187:         var project, projection, t;
  >> 188:         project = function(λ, φ) {
     189:           var p0, p1, _ref1;
     190:           λ *= 180 / Math.PI;
     191:           φ *= 180 / Math.PI;

Above command is synonymous to ``catn js/main.js 188 3``, ``catn
js/main.js:188`` and ``catn js/main.js:188:3``, where "3" means "3 lines of
context" (can be omitted as 3 is the default value there).

``catn -q ...`` outputs line + context verbatim, so it'd be more useful for
piping to another file/command or terminal copy-paste.

git_terminate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script to permanently delete files/folders from repository and its history -
including "dangling" objects where these might still exist.

Should be used from repo root with a list of paths to delete, e.g.
``git_terminate path1 path2``.

WARNING: will do things like ``git reflog expire`` and ``git gc`` with agressive
parameters on the whole repository, so any other possible history not stashed or
linked to existing branches/remotes (e.g. stuff in ``git reflog``) will be
purged.

git_contains
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Checks if passed tree-ish (hash, trimmed hash, branch name, etc - see
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" in git-rev-parse(1)) object(s) exist (e.g.  merged) in a
specified git repo/tree-ish.

Essentially does ``git rev-list <tree-ish2> | grep $(git rev-parse
<tree-ish1>)``.

::

  % git_contains -C /var/src/linux-git ee0073a1e7b0ec172
  [exit status=0, hash was found]

  % git_contains -C /var/src/linux-git ee0073a1e7b0ec172 HEAD notarealthing
  Missing:
    notarealthing
  [status=2 right when rev-parse fails before even starting rev-list]

  % git_contains -C /var/src/linux-git -H v3.5 --quiet ee0073a1e7b0ec172
  [status=2, this commit is in HEAD, but not in v3.5 (tag), --quiet doesn't produce stdout]

  % git_contains -C /var/src/linux-git --any ee0073a1e7b0ec172 notarealthing
  [status=0, ee0073a1e7b0ec172 was found, and it's enough with --any]

  % git_contains -C /var/src/linux-git --strict notarealthing
  fatal: ambiguous argument 'notarealting': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
  Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
  'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
  git rev-parse failed for tree-ish 'notarealting' (command: ['git', 'rev-parse', 'notarealting'])

Lines in square brackets above are comments, not actual output.

gtk-val-slider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Renders gtk3 window with a slider widget and writes value (float or int) picked
there either to stdout or to a specified file, with some rate-limiting delay.

Useful to mock/control values on a dev machine.

E.g. instead of hardware sensors (which might be hard to get/connect/use), just
setup app to read value(s) that should be there from file(s), specify proper
value range to the thing and play around with values all you want to see what
happens.



backup
~~~~~~

Various dedicated backup tools and snippets.

ssh-r-sync / ssh-r-sync-recv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"ssh -Rsync" - SSH shell and client to negotiate/run rsync pulls over ssh
reverse tunnels ("ssh -R") without any extra client-side setup.

Just running ``ssh-r-sync user@backup-host somedir`` should ssh into
user\@backup-host, with auto-selected reverse-tunnel (-R) spec depending on
local machine name, pass backup parameters and run ``rsync --daemon`` locally,
allowing remote backup-host to initiate a pull from this daemon over established
secure/authenticated ssh tunnel, picking appropriate destination path and most
rsync parameters, rotating/removing stuff on the backup-fs (via hooks) as necessary.

This is done to avoid following problematic things:

- Pushing stuff to backup-host, which can be exploited to delete stuff.
- Using insecure network channels and/or rsync auth - ssh only.
- Having any kind of insecure auth or port open on backup-host (e.g. rsyncd) - ssh only.
- Requiring backed-up machine to be accessible on the net for backup-pulls - can
  be behind any amount of NAT layers, and only needs one outgoing ssh connection.
- Specifying/handling backup parameters (beyond --filter lists), rotation and
  cleanup on the backed-up machine - backup-host will handle all that in a
  known-good and uniform manner.
- Running rsyncd or such with unrestricted fs access "for backups" - only
  runs it on localhost port with one-time auth for ssh connection lifetime,
  restricted to specified read-only path, with local filter rules on top.
- Needing anything beyond basic ssh/rsync/python on either side.

Idea is to have backup process be as simple as ssh'ing into backup-host,
only specifying path and filter specs for what it should grab.

rsync is supposed to start by some regular uid on either end, so if full fs
access is needed, -r/--rsync option can be used to point to rsync binary that
has cap_dac_read_search (read) / cap_dac_override (write) posix capabilities
or whatever wrapper script doing similar thing, e.g.::

  # cp /usr/bin/rsync ~backup/
  # setcap cap_dac_override,cap_chown,cap_fowner=ep ~backup/rsync

| ...and add ``-r ~/rsync`` to ssh-r-sync-recv ForceCommand to use that binary.
Note: rsync with full rw fs access is usually same as "NOPASSWD: ALL" sudo.

To use any special rsync options or pre/post-sync actions on the backup-host side
(such as backup file manifest, backup rotation and free space management,
rsync output/errors checking, etc), hook scripts can be used there,
see ``ssh-r-sync-recv --hook-list`` for more info.

| Only needs python3 + ssh + rsync on either side.
| See ``ssh-r-sync-recv -h`` for sshd_config setup notes.

ssh-dump
^^^^^^^^

Bash wrapper around ssh to run it in non-interactive command mode, storing
output to specified path with date-suffix and optional compression/rotation.

Implements very basic operation of grabbing either some command output or file
contents from remote host for backup purposes.

Passes bunch of common options to use ssh batch mode, disable non-key auth and
enable keepalive in case of long-running remote commands.


desktop
~~~~~~~

Helpers for more interactive (client) machine, DE and apps there.


uri_handlers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scripts to delegate downloads from firefox to a more sensible download managers.

Mostly I use remote mldonkey for ed2k and regular http downloads and rtorrent /
transmission for bittorrent (with some processing of .torrent files to drop
long-dead trackers from there and flatten tracker tiers, for reasons I blogged
about in some distant past).


media
^^^^^

Scripts - mostly wrappers around ffmpeg and pulseaudio - to work with (or
process) various media files and streams.

parec_from_flash
''''''''''''''''

Creates null-sink in pulseaudio and redirects browser flash plugin audio output
stream to it, also starting "parec" and oggenc to record/encode whatever happens
there.

Can be useful to convert video to podcast if downloading flv is tricky for
whatever reason.

pa_track_history
''''''''''''''''

Queries pa sinks for specific pid (which it can start) and writes "media.name"
(usually track name) history, which can be used to record played track names
from e.g. online radio stream in player-independent fashion.

pa_mute
'''''''

Simple script to toggle mute for all pluseaudio streams from a specified pid.

pa_modtoggle
''''''''''''

Script to toggle - load or unload - pulseaudio module.

For example, to enable/disable forwarding sound over network (e.g. to be played
in vlc as rtp://224.0.0.56:9875)::

  % pa_modtoggle module-rtp-send \
    source=alsa-speakers.monitor destination=224.0.0.56 port=9875
  Loaded: [31] module-rtp-send source=alsa-speakers.monitor destination=224.0.0.56 port=9875

Same exact command will unload the module (matching it by module name only), if necessary.

Optional -s/--status flag can be used to print whether module is currently loaded.

Uses/requires `pulsectl module`_, Python-3.

.. _pulsectl module: https://github.com/mk-fg/python-pulse-control/

mpv_icy_track_history
'''''''''''''''''''''

Same as pa_track_history above, but gets tracks when mpv_ dumps icy-\* tags
(passed in shoutcast streams) to stdout, which should be at the start of every
next track.

More efficient and reliable than pa_track_history, but obviously mpv-specific.

.. _mpv: http://mpv.io/

icy_record
''''''''''

Simple script to dump "online radio" kind of streams to a bunch of separate
files, split when stream title (as passed in icy StreamTitle metadata) changes.

By default, filenames will include timestamp of recording start, sequence
number, timestamp of a track start and a stream title (in a filename-friendly
form).

Sample usage: ``icy_record --debug -x http://pub5.di.fm/di_vocaltrance``

Note that by default dumped streams will be in some raw adts format (as streamed
over the net), so maybe should be converted (with e.g. ffmpeg) afterwards.

This doesn't seem to be an issue for at least mp3 streams though, which work
fine as "MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1" even in dumb hardware players.

radio
'''''

Wrapper around mpv_icy_track_history to pick and play hard-coded radio
streams with appropriate settings, generally simplified ui, logging and echoing
what's being played, with a mute button (on SIGQUIT button from terminal).

toogg
'''''

Any-media-to-ogg convertor, using ffmpeg and - optionally (with -l/--loudnorm) -
its `loudnorm filter`_ (EBU R128 loudness normalization) in double-pass mode.

Main purpose is to turn anything that has audio track in it into podcast for an
audio player.

Can process several source files or URLs (whatever youtube-dl accepts) in
parallel, split large files into chunks (processed concurrently), displays
progress (from ``ffmpeg -progress`` pipe), python3/asyncio.

loudnorm filter is fairly recent addition to ffmpeg (added in 3.1 release of
2016-06-27, has libebur128 built-in in 3.2+), and might not be available in
distros by default.

Needs youtube-dl installed if URLs are specified instead of regular files.

.. _loudnorm filter: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#loudnorm

totty
'''''

Wrapper around awesome img2xterm_ tool to display images in a color-capable
terminal (e.g. xterm, not necessarily terminology).

Useful to query "which image is it" right from tty. Quality of the resulting
images is kinda amazing, given tty limitations.

.. _img2xterm: https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm

split
'''''

Simple bash script to split media files into chunks of specified length (in
minutes), e.g. ``split some-long-audiobook.mp3 sla 20`` will produce
20-min-long sla-001.mp3, sla-002.mp3, sla-003.mp3, etc.

| Last length arg can be omitted, and defaults to 15 min.
| Can split/rename multiple files when used as e.g.: ``split prefix -- *.mp3``

Uses ffprobe (ffmpeg) to get duration and ffmpeg with "-acodec copy -vn"
(default, changed by passing these after duration arg) to grab only audio chunks
from the source file.

audio_split_m4b
'''''''''''''''

Splits m4b audiobook files on chapters (list of which are encoded into m4b as
metadata) with ffprobe/ffmpeg.

Chapter offsets and titles are detected via ``ffprobe -v 0 -show_chapters``, and
then each gets extracted with ``ffmpeg -i ... -acodec copy -ss ... -to ...``,
producing aac files with names corresponding to metadata titles (by default, can
be controlled with --name-format, default is ``{n:03d}__{title}.aac``).

Doesn't do any transcoding, which can easily be performed later to e.g.  convert
resulting aac files to mp3 or ogg, if necessary.

twitch_vod_fetch
''''''''''''''''

Script to download any time slice of a twitch.tv VoD (video-on-demand).

This is the latest version that's been tested and confirmed to work on Windows,
see `mk-fg's repository`_ for the absolute latest version (which has been tested
on a Unix-like OS and may or may not work on Windows).

youtube-dl_ - the usual tool for the job - `doesn't support neither seeking to
time nor length limits`_, but does a good job of getting a VoD m3u8 playlist
with chunks of the video (--get-url option).

Also, some chunks getting stuck here at ~10-20 KiB/s download rates, making
"sequentially download each one" approach of mpv/youtube-dl/ffmpeg/etc highly
inpractical, and there are occasional errors too.

So this wrapper grabs that playlist, skips chunks according to EXTINF tags
(specifying exact time length of each) to satisfy --start-pos / --length, and
then passes all these URLs to aria2_ for parallel downloading with stuff
like --max-concurrent-downloads=5, --max-connection-per-server=5,
--lowest-speed-limit=100K, etc (see TVFConfig at the start of the script),
also scheduling retries for any failed chunks a few times with delays.

In the end, chunks get concatenated (literally, think "cat") together into one
resulting mp4 file.

Process is designed to tolerate Ctrl+C (or SIGKILL) and resume from any point,
keeping some temporary files around for that until file is fully downloaded.

Includes "--scatter" ("-x") mode to download every-X-out-of-Y timespans instead
of full video, and has source timestamps on seeking in concatenated result
(e.g. for ``-x 2:00/15:00``, minute 3 in the video should display as "16:00",
making it easier to pick timespan to download properly).

Video chunks get concatenated into partial file as they get downloaded, allowing
to start playback before whole process ends.

General usage examples (wrapped)::

ytdl-chan
'''''''''

Bash wrapper script around youtube-dl_ tool to download numbered range of videos
(from n_first to n_last) for youtube channel in reverse order to how they're
listed in the metadata cache file (usually latest-to-oldest, hence reverse
order).

Basically a thing to binge-watch everything from some channel, in order, without
instantly running out of disk space.

Usage is simply ``ytdl-chan 1 10`` to e.g. download 10 (1st to 10th) oldest
videos (numbers are inclusive, 1-indexed) on the channel to the current dir,
numbering them accordingly (``001__sometitle.mp4``, ``002__...``, etc).

Run in an empty dir with any numbers to get more info on how to get metadata
cache file (list of yt json manifests, one per line).

Be sure to use ``~/.config/youtube-dl/config`` for any ytdl opts, as necessary,
or override these via env / within a script.

Requires youtube-dl_ and `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ (to parse URLs
from json).

streamdump
''''''''''

Bash wrapper for streamlink_ to make dumping stream to a file more reliable,
auto-restarting the process with new filename after any "stream ended" events or
streamlink app exits.

Example use::

  % streamdump --retry-streams 60 --retry-open 99999 \
    --twitch-disable-hosting --twitch-oauth-token ... \
    twitch.tv/user 720p -fo dump.mp4

Will create "dump.000.mp4", "dump.001.mp4" and so on for each stream restart.

Intended use is for unreliable streams which go down and back up again in a
minute or few, or working around streamlink quirks and fatal errors.

.. _streamlink: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink


notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A bunch of tools to issue various desktop notifications.

exec
''''

Wrapper to run specified command and notify (via `desktop-notifications`_ only
atm) if it fails (including "no such binary" errors) or produces any stderr.

Optionally produces notification in any case.

Useful mainly for wrapping hooks in desktop apps like firefox, to know if click
on some "magnet:..." link was successfully processed or discarded.

::

  % notify.exec -h --
  usage: notify.exec [ options... -- ] command [ arguments... ]

  Wrapper for command execution results notification.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -e, --exit-code-only  Issue notification only if exit code not equals zero,
                          despite stderr.
    -v, --notify-on-success
                          Issue notification upon successful execution as well.
    -d, --dump            Include stdou/stderr for all notifications.

.. _desktop-notifications: http://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/

power
'''''

Script to spam `desktop-notifications`_ when charger gets plugged/unplugged via
udev rules on an old laptop with somewhat flaky power connector.

Useful to save a few battery/power cycles due to random electrical contact loss
in charger or just plain negligence, if nothing else in DE has good indication
for that already.

| Uses python3/pyudev and systemd dbus lib via ctypes for notifications.
| Run with --print-systemd-unit to get systemd/udev templates.

logtail
'''''''

Script to watch log files (as many as necessary) for changes with inotify and
report any new lines appearing there via desktop notifications, handling file
rotation (via truncation or rename/unlink) and such.

Can remember last position in file either by recording it in file's xattrs or in
a shelve db (specified via -x/--xattr-db option).
Doesn't do much with it by default though, starting to read files from the end,
but that can be fixed by passing --keep-pos.

Has --tb-rate-filter option to rate-limit occasional log-spam (reporting only
"skipped N msgs" as soon as filter allows) via simple token-bucket filter, see
-h/--help output for more info.

Somewhat advanced usage example::

  % logtail \
    --keep-pos --tb-rate-filter 1:5 \
    --icon ~/media/appz/icons/biohazard_48x.png \
    --xattr-db "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"/logtail.db \
    /var/log/messages /var/log/important/*

Python-3, needs python-gobject ("gi" module, for notifications), uses inotify
via ctypes.

mail
''''

Daemon script to monitor dovecot delivery logs (either generic ones, or produced
via "mail_log" plugin), efficiently find delivered messages by their message-id
and issue desktop notification to a remote host with parsed message details
(path it was filed under, decoded from and subject headers).

Things like rsyslog make it fairly easy to create a separate log with such
notifications for just one user, e.g.::

  if (
    $programname == 'dovecot'
    and $syslogfacility-text == 'mail'
    and $syslogseverity-text == 'info'
    and re_match($msg, '^lda\\(someuser\\): sieve: msgid=[^:]+: stored mail into mailbox .*') )
  then action(
    type="omfile" FileCreateMode="0660"
    FileOwner="root" FileGroup="someuser"
    File="/var/log/processing/mail.deliver.someuser.log" )

Remote notifications are delivered to desktop machines via robust zeromq pub/sub
sockets `as implemented in notification-thing daemon`_ I have for that purpose.

Even idle-imap doesn't seem to provide proper push notifications with multiple
folders yet, and this simple hack doesn't even require running a mail client.

.. _as implemented in notification-thing daemon: https://github.com/mk-fg/notification-thing/#network-broadcasting

icon
''''

Script to display specified xdg icon or image in a transparent popup window,
with specified size (proportional scaling) and offset.

Supposed to be used with compositing WMs to display an icon (e.g. png with
transparency) on top of everything else as a very crude and "in your face"
means of notification.

For example, ``icon -o=-10%:-10% -s=300 ~/battery-critical.png``
will display specified png scaled proportionately to 300x300 px box
with 10% (of screen width/height) offset from bottom-right screen corner.

``icon call-start`` will dislay "call-start" icon from the theme
(with -s/--size specifying icon size to pick, e.g. 32, 64, 128).

If file/icon cannot be found, ``Error: {icon-name}`` replacement text
will be displayed in a semi-transparent box instead.

Stuff gets displayed until process is terminated. Uses gtk3/pygobject.


others
^^^^^^

pick_tracks
'''''''''''

A simple tool to randomly pick and copy files (intended usage is music tracks)
from source to destination.

Difference from "cp" is that it will stop when destination will be filled (to
the configurable --min-df threshold) and will pick files in arbitrary order from
arbitrary path hierarchy.

Use-case is simple - insert an SD card from a player and do::

  % mount /mnt/sd_card
  % rm -rf /mnt/sd_card/music
  % pick_tracks -s 200 /mnt/music/OverClocked_Remix /mnt/sd_card/music
  INFO:root:Done: 1673.1 MiB, rate: 1.29 MiB/s

"--debug" also keeps track of what's being done and calculates how much time is
left based on df-goal and median rate.

Source dir has like `3k files`_ in many dirs, and cp/rsync will do the dumb
"we'll copy same first things every time", while this tool will create the dst
path for you, copy always-new selection there and - due to "-s 200" - leave 200
MiB there for podcasts you might want to also upload.

As with "cp", ``pick_tracks /path1 /path2 /dst`` is perfectly valid.

And there are neat cleaup flags for cases when I need to cram something new to
the destination, preserving as much of the stuff that's already there as
possible (and removing least important stuff).

Cleanup (if requested) also picks stuff at random up to necessary df.

"--shuffle" option allows to shuffle paths on fat by temporarily copying them
off the media to some staging area and back in random order.

Use-case is dumb mp3 players that don't have that option (see also vfat_shuffler
script for these, which is way more efficient).

Uses plumbum_ to call "rsync --inplace" (faster than "cp" in most cases) and
"find" to do the actual copy/listing.

.. _3k files: http://ocremix.org/torrents/
.. _plumbum: http://plumbum.readthedocs.org

link
''''

ssh wrapper to save time on typing something like ``exec ssh -X -A -p3542
root@1.2.3.4 'screen -DR'``, especially for N remote hosts.

Also has the ability to "keep trying to connect", useful (to me, at least) for
crappy shared-hosting servers, where botnets flood ssh with slowloris-like
attacks on it's authentication, exceeding limit on unauthorized connections in
sshd.

e_config_backup
'''''''''''''''

Yapps2_-based (grammar as-is in \*.g file) parser script for Enlightenment (E17)
config file (doing eet-decoding beforehand) for the purposes of it's backup in
`de-setup git repo`_ alongside other DE-related configuration.

Whole purpose of decoding/encoding dance is to sort the sections (which E orders
at random) and detect/filter-out irrelevant changes like remembered window
positions or current (`auto-rotated`_) wallpaper path.

.. _Yapps2: https://github.com/mk-fg/yapps
.. _de-setup git repo: https://github.com/mk-fg/de-setup
.. _auto-rotated: http://desktop-aura.sourceforge.net/

vfat_shuffler
'''''''''''''

Python script to list/shuffle/order and do some other things to LFN entries
inside vfat filesystem directory without mounting the thing.

Implemented to work around limitations of crappy cheap mp3 players that don't
have shuffle (or any ordering) functionality and cycle tracks in the same order
as their dentries_ appear on fs.

Easy way to "shuffle" stuff for these in a quick and efficient manner is to swap
dentries' places, which (unfortunately) requires re-implementing a bit of vfat
driver code, which (fortunately) isn't that complicated.

Tool takes path to device and directory to operate on as arguments (see --help)
and has -l/--list (simply list files, default), -s/--shuffle (shuffle
operation), ---o/order, --rename plus some other action-opts (all support
-r/--recursive operation), and ``--debug --dry-run`` can be useful to check what
script does without making any fs changes (opens device read-only).

See -h/--help output for more info and usage examples.

One limitation is that it only works with FAT32 "vfat" fs type, which can be
created via "mkfs.vfat" tool, *not* the stuff that "mkdosfs" tool creates,
*not* FAT16, FAT12, exFAT or whatever other variations are out there (they're
slightly different and I didn't need any of them, so not implemented).

Might be useful base to hack some fat32-related tool, as it has everything
necessary for full r/w implementation - e.g. a tool to hardlink files on fat32,
create infinite dir loops, undelete tool, etc.

Due to bunch of heavy parsing done inside, can take a few seconds to process
whole fs structure, and works ~5x faster with `pypy <http://pypy.org/>`_
(e.g. 1.5s instead of 9s).

Uses python/pypy 3.x and `construct module <https://construct.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Somewhat similar project (which I didn't find at the time of implementing this
back in 2013) - `maxpat78/FATtools <https://github.com/maxpat78/FATtools/>`_.

.. _dentries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#Directory_entry

fan_control
'''''''''''

Script to control speed of dying laptop fan on Acer S3 using direct reads/writes
from/to ``/dev/ports`` to not run it too fast (causing loud screech and
vibrating plastic) yet trying to keep cpu cool enough.

Or, failing that, use cpupower tool to drop frequency (making it run cooler in
general) and issue dire warnings to desktop.

emms_beets_enqueue
''''''''''''''''''

Script to query beets_ music database (possibly on a remote host) with specified
parameters and add found tracks to EMMS_ playlist (via emacsclient).

Also allows to just dump resulting paths or enqueue a list of them from stdin.

.. _beets: http://beets.readthedocs.org/
.. _EMMS: https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/

ff_backup
'''''''''

Script to backup various firefox settings in a diff/scm-friendly manner
(i.e. decoded from horrible one-liner json into pyaml_, so that they can be
tracked in e.g. git.

Written out of frustration about how YouTube Center seem to loose its shit and
resets config sometimes.

Can/should be extended to all sorts of other ff/ext settings in the future - and
probably is already, see its yaml config for details.

ff_mozlz4
'''''''''

Simple py3 script to decompress .mozlz4 files, which can be found in FF profile
directory (e.g. search.json.mozlz4), and are ``"mozLz40\0" || lz4-compressed-data``,
which lz4 cli tool can't handle due to that mozLz40 header.

Same cli interface as with gzip/xz/lz4 and such, uses `lz4
<https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4/>`_ module (``pip3 install --user lz4``).

Usage example (`jq tool <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ is for pretty json)::

  % ff_mozlz4 < search.json.mozlz4 | jq . > search.json
  % nano search.json
  % ff_mozlz4 search.json

bt_agent
''''''''

BlueZ bluetooth authorization agent script/daemon.

Usually included into DE-specific bluetooth applet or can be used from
"bluetoothctl" client (``agent on``), but I don't have former (plus just don't
want to rely on any DE much) and latter isn't suitable to run daemonized.

When run interactively (``-i/--interactive`` option), will ask permission (y/n)
to authorize new pairings and enter PINs for these.

With ``-a/--authorize-services [whitelist-file]`` option (and optional list of
bdaddrs), will allow any paired device to (re-)connect without asking, allowing
to run it in the background to only authorize trusted (and/or whitelisted)
devices.

Does device power-on by default, has ``-p/--pairable [seconds]``,
``-d/--discoverable [seconds]`` and ``-t/--set-trusted`` options to cover usual
initialization routines.

Python-3.x, needs dbus-python module with glib loop support.

alarm
'''''

Script to issue notification(s) after some specified period of time.

Mostly to simplify combining "sleep" with "date" and whatever notification means
in the shell.

Parses timestamps as relative short times (e.g. "30s", "10min", "1h 20m", etc),
iso8601-ish times/dates or falls back to just using "date" binary (which parses
a lot of stuff).

Checks that specified time was parsed as a timestamp in the future and outputs
how it was interpreted (by default).

Examples:

.. code:: console

  % alarm -q now
  % alarm -c timedatectl now
  Parsed time_spec 'now' as 2015-04-26 14:23:54.658134 (delta: just now)

.. figure:: http://fraggod.net/static/misc/notification-thing__alarm.jpg
   :alt: notification popup

.. code:: console

  % alarm -t 3600 -i my-alarm-icon -s my-alarm-sound -f 'tomorrow 9am' \
    'hey, wake up!!!' "It's time to do some stuff... here's the schedule:" \
    -c 'curl -s http://my-site.com/schedule/today'
  Parsed time_spec 'tomorrow 9am' as 2015-04-27 09:00:00 (delta: 18h 25m)

Currently only uses desktop notifications, libcanberra sounds (optional),
mail/wall (optional fallbacks) and/or runs whatever commands (use e.g. "zenity"
to create modal windows or "wall" for terminal broadcasts).

Can keep track of pending alarms if -p/--pid-file option is used (see also
-l/-list and -k/--kill opts), for persistent notifications (between reboots and
such), there's an --at option to use at(1p) daemon.

Python-3, needs python-gobject ("gi" module) for desktop notifications.

acpi-wakeup-config
''''''''''''''''''

Bash script to statelessly enable/disable (and not toggle) events in
``/proc/acpi/wakeup`` (wakeup events from various system sleep states).

E.g. ``acpi-wakeup-config -LID0`` to disable "opening lid wakes up laptop"
regardless of its current setting.

Usual ``echo LID0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup`` toggles the knob, which is inconvenient
when one wants to set it to a specific value.

Also has special ``+all`` and ``-all`` switches to enable/disable all events and
prints the whole wakeup-table if ran without arguments.

olaat
'''''

"one-letter-at-a-time" script to display (via gtk3/gi) a semi-transparent
overlay with lines from stdin, which one can navigate up/down and left/right wrt
highlighted characters.

Useful to do any kind of letter-by-letter checks and stuff manually.

Can also be an example code / stub for composited screen overlays with input
grab.

blinds
''''''

Py3/Gtk3 script to draw an empty colored/transparent window with custom hints
(default: undecorated) and size/position just to cover some screen area.

Useful as a hack to cover windows that grab input or do something stupid on
mouseover, but still be able to see their contents, or maybe just cover
something on the screen entirely.

For example, to cover left half (960px-wide) of screen with greenish-tinted
half-transparent pane: ``blinds --pos=960xS+0 --color=0227107f``

With custom wm hints/opacity::

  blinds -o 0.2 -x 'stick keep_above skip_taskbar skip_pager -accept_focus -resizable'

(see -h/--help output for a full list of these)

evdev-to-xev
''''''''''''

Simple tool to bind events (and specific values passed with these) from
arbitrary evdev device(s) to keyboard button presses (through uinput).

"evdev -> keyboard" mappings are specified in a YAML file, as well as some other
minor parameters (e.g. how long to press keys for, intervals, delays, etc).

For example, to bind rightmost-ish joystick position to press "right" key,
yaml mapping can have this line: ``ABS_X >30_000: right`` (absolute right is
~32768, so anything >30k is "close enough", "30_000" is valid YAML integer spec).

Or, to type stuff on gamepad button press: ``BTN_SOUTH 1: [t,e,s,t,enter]``

| Script can be run without any options to print config file example.
| Can work with multiple evdev inputs (uses asyncio to poll stuff).

Requires python3, python-evdev_, standard "uinput" kernel module enabled/loaded,
read access to specified evdev(s) and rw to /dev/uinput.

.. _python-evdev: http://python-evdev.readthedocs.org/

exclip
''''''

Small standalone C binary based on xclip_ code to copy primary X11 selection
text (utf-8) from terminal (or whatever else) to clipboard as a single line,
stripping any stray tabs/newlines that might get in there (due to terminal
quirks, e.g. with screen/tmux/ncurses) and spaces at the start/end,
unless -x/--verbatim is specified.

Basically what something like "xclip -out | <process> | xclip -in" would do,
except as a tiny fast-to-run binary (to bind to a key), and with multiplexing
(to clipboard and back to primary).

Build with: ``gcc -O2 -lX11 -lXmu exclip.c -o exclip && strip exclip``

Safe wrt NUL-bytes, but should not be used without -x/--verbatim on multi-byte
non-utf-8 encodings (where \\n byte can mean something else), and won't strip
any weird non-ascii utf-8 spaces.

Has -d/--slashes-to-dots option to copy paths as dotted prefixes, with same
caveats as above.

.. _xclip: https://github.com/astrand/xclip



VM
~~

Scripts to start and manage qemu/kvm based VMs I use for various dev purposes.

These include starting simple vde-based networking, syncing kernels and
initramfs images out of vms (where needed), doing suspend/resume for running vms
easily, etc.

Don't really need abstractions libvirt (and stuff using it) provide on top of
qemu/kvm, as latter already have decent enough interfaces to work with.

Cheatsheet for qemu-img commands::

  % qemu-img create -f qcow2 stuff.qcow2 10G
  % qemu-img create -b stuff.qcow2 -f qcow2 stuff.qcow2.inc
  % qemu-img commit stuff.qcow2.inc && rm stuff.qcow2.inc \
    && qemu-img create -b stuff.qcow2 -f qcow2 stuff.qcow2.inc



sysdig
~~~~~~

Lua `"chisels"`_ for `sysdig tool`_.

Basically simple scripts to filter and format data that sysdig reads or collects
in real-time for various common tasks.

.. _"chisels": https://github.com/draios/sysdig/wiki/Chisels%20User%20Guide
.. _sysdig tool: https://github.com/draios/sysdig/



aufs
~~~~

A few tools to work with a layered aufs filesystem on arm boards.

aubrsync
^^^^^^^^

Modified script from aufs2-util.git, but standalone (with stuff from aufs.shlib
baked-in) and not failing on ro-remounts, which seem to be a common thing for
some places like /var or /home.

aufs_sync
^^^^^^^^^

Convenience wrapper around aubrsync for mounts like ``none /var -o
br:/aufs/rw/var=rw:/aufs/ro/var=ro``.

Can also just list what's there to be synced with "check" command.

::

  Usage: aufs_sync { copy | move | check } module
  Example (flushes /var): aufs_sync move var



arch
~~~~

Tools for automating various Arch Linux tasks.

elf-deps
^^^^^^^^

Shows shared-lib dependencies for specified binary/so even if it's for different
arch (``objdump-deps`` option), packages they might belong to (``objdump-pkgs``)
and deps-of-deps recursively (``ldd-deep`` / ``ldd-deep-pkgs``).

For instance, when one wants to figure out which .so files ELF32 binary might
want to use::

  % elf-deps objdump-deps ~player/gog/SRHK/game/SRHK
  /usr/lib/libGL.so.1
  /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2.0
  /usr/lib/libGLU.so.1
  ...

If one then wants to grab all these from some 32-bit packages (on a vm or maybe
some chroot, see also ``tar-strap`` tool), ``objdump-pkgs`` might help::

  % elf-deps objdump-pkgs ~player/gog/SRHK/game/SRHK
  gcc-libs
  glibc
  ...

And to list all deps of a binary or a lib and their deps recursively, there's
``ldd-deep`` and ``ldd-deep-pkgs``::

  % elf-deps ldd-deep /usr/lib/libGL.so
  /usr/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
  /usr/lib/libX11-xcb.so.1
  ...

  % elf-deps ldd-deep-pkgs /usr/lib/libGL.so
  expat
  glibc
  libdrm
  ...

Can be useful for providing necessary stuff to run proprietary 32-bit binaries
(like games or crapware) on amd64.

pacman-manifest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates text manifests for Arch setup in ``/var/lib/pacman/``:

* db.explict - explicitly installed packages, names only.

* db.leaf - packages without anything depending on them, names only.

* db.extras - packages not in any pacman repos, names only.

* db.all - all installed packages, names and versions.

* db.diffs - list of ``\.pac(new|orig|save)$`` files on the system (found via
  mlocate).

* db.local - list of stuff in ``/usr/local``.

Taken together, these represent some kind of "current os state".

Useful to pull them all into some git to keep track what gets installed or
updated in the system over time, including makepkg'ed things and ad-hoc stuff in
/usr/local.

pacman-extra-files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists files that don't belong to any of the packages in either in default
``/etc /opt /usr`` dirs or whichever ones are specified.

pacman-pacnew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My version of utility to merge .pacnew files with originals, using convenient
and familiar (at least to me) ``git add -p`` interface and git diffs in general.

Can build list of files to process from last update in pacman.log (-a/--auto
option), locate (e.g. mlocate, -l/--locate opt) or these can be specified
manually as args.

Copies all original and associated pacnew files to tmp dir, and runs ``git add
-p`` to apply/rebase original files on top of pacnew ones, showing resulting
``git diff original merged`` and prompting for whether to apply all the changes
there.

Has misc options to skip parts of that process (-y/--yes, -o/--old, -n/--new),
should be relatively safe against whatever accidents, breaks and typos - only
changes stuff at the very end, if all commands worked, all checks pass and
confirmation received.

Bash script, requires git and perl (as "git-add--interactive" is a perl script).
Shorter and simplier than most scripts for same purpose, as git does most of the
work in this case, less wheels re-invented, less interfaces to learn/remember.


tar-strap
^^^^^^^^^

Wrapper to quickly download and setup archlinux chroot (for e.g. systemd-nspawn
container) using bootstrap tarball from https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/latest/

Checks gpg sig on the tarball with pacman-key, copies basic stuff like
locale.gen, resolv.conf, mirrorlist, pacman gnupg setup, etc from the current
root into the new one and runs arch-chroot into that.

Should be way faster than pacstrap, but kinda similar otherwise.

Either URL or path to source tarball should be specified on the command line.

can-strap
^^^^^^^^^

Wrapper to bootstrap ready-to-use Arch container ("can") in /var/lib/machines,
which (at the moment of writing) boils down to these steps:

* mkdir && pacstrap

* Copy layout files: localtime, profile, locale.conf, locale.gen.

* Copy basic tools' configuration files,
  such as: zsh, screenrc, nanorc, gitconfig, etc.

  But only copy each if it exists on the host machine
  (hence likely to be useful in a container as well).

* systemd-nspawn into container and run locale-gen and do chsh to zsh,
  if it's set as $SHELL on the host.

pacstrap installs not just any specified packages, but intentionally prefixes
each with "can-" - these are meta-packages that I use to pull in package groups
suitable for containers.

They all should be in my `archlinux-pkgbuilds`_ repo, see e.g. `can-base
PKGBUILD`_ for example of such metapackage.

Running ``can-strap -c pacman.i686.conf buildbot-32 tools -- -i``
(intentionally complicated example) will produce "buildbot-32" container,
suitable to boot and log into with e.g. ``systemd-nspawn -bn -M buildbot-32``.

scraps
~~~~~~

Misc prefabs and *really* ad-hoc scripts.

gnuplot-free
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rolling plot of "free" output via gnuplot.

Mostly a reminder of how to use the thing and what one can do with it.

There's more info on it in `gnuplot-for-live-last-30-seconds`_ blog post.

.. _gnuplot-for-live-last-30-seconds: http://blog.fraggod.net/2015/03/25/gnuplot-for-live-last-30-seconds-sliding-window-of-free-memory-data.html

rsync-diff
^^^^^^^^^^

Script to sync paths, based on berkley db and rsync.

Keeps b-tree of paths (files and dirs) and corresponding mtimes in berkdb,
comparing state when ran and building a simple merge-filter for rsync (``+
/path`` line for each changed file/dir, including their path components, ending
with ``- *``). Then it runs a single rsync with this filter to efficiently sync
the paths.

Note that the only difference from "rsync -a src dst" here is that "dst" tree
doesn't have to exist on fs, otherwise scanning "dst" should be pretty much the
same (and probably more efficient, depending on fs implementation) b-tree
traversal as with berkdb.

Wrote it before realizing that it's quite pointless for my mirroring use-case -
do have full source and destination trees, so rsync can be used to compare
(if diff file-list is needed) or sync them.

pcap-process
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processor for tshark's xml (pdml) output, for cases when wireshark's
filtering/ui is not enough or it should be automated.

log-tail-check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script (or a template of one) designed to be run periodically to process latest
log entries.

Handles log rotation/truncation and multiple changing logs cases.

Only reads actually last lines, storing last position and hash of "N bytes after
that" (incl. N itself) in files' "user." xattrs, to reliably detect if file was
rotated/truncated on the next run (i.e. if offset doesn't exist or there's diff
data there).

Also stores state of the actual processing there, which is just "check occurence
of regexp 'name' group within timeout, print line if there isn't" in the script.

check-df
^^^^^^^^

Standard template for a trivial bash + coreutils "df" checker to put into
crontab on any random linux box, just in case.

resize-rpi-fat32-for-card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script to resize RPi's boot FAT32 partition and filesystem to conver as much of
the SD card as possible, from RPi itself, while booted from the same card.

Needs python-2.7, modern util-linux_ tools (lsblk and sfdisk with -J option for
json output), sleuthkit_ (to query size of FAT fs), and parted_.

More info on this script can be found in the `resizing-first-fat32-partition-...`_
blog post.

.. _resizing-first-fat32-partition-...: http://blog.fraggod.net/2015/12/07/resizing-first-fat32-partition-to-microsd-card-size-on-boot-from-raspberry-pi.html

d3-line-chart-boilerplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boilerplate `d3.js`_ page for basic line chart to plot arbitrary JS function
outputs or data array with axii, grid, mouseover datapoint tooltips and such.

Useful when for a quick chart to figure out some data or function output,
or make it into a useful non-static link to someone,
and don't want to deal with d3-v3/coding-style/JS diffs from bl.ocks.org.

.. _d3.js: http://d3js.org/

d3-temp-rh-sensor-tsv-series-chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`d3.js`_-based ES6 graphing app for time-series data from rather common
temperature (t) and relative humidity (rh) sensors (DHT22, sht1x, etc) in tsv
(tab-separated-values) files with [iso8601-ts, t, rh] fields.

Can be used directly via gh-pages: `d3-temp-rh-sensor-tsv-series-chart.html`_

Bunch of real-world sample tsv files for it can be found alongside the html in
`d3-temp-rh-sensor-tsv-series-chart.zip`_.

Assembled (from simple html, d3.v4.js and main js) via html-embed script from
this repo, doesn't have any external links, can be easily used as a local file.

More info can be found in the `d3-chart-for-common-temperaturerh-time-series-data`_
blog post.

d3-du-disk-space-usage-layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`D3`_-based xdiskusage_ implementation - app to parse ``du -b`` output and
display directory hierarchy as d3 "partition" layout, with node size
proportional to directory size from du output.

Can be used directly via gh-pages (`d3-du-disk-space-usage-layout.html`_)
or as a local file, doesn't have any external links.

Allows uploading multiple files to display in the same hierarchy, if paths in
them are absolute (otherwise each one will be prefixed by "root-X" pseudo-node).

.. _d3-du-disk-space-usage-layout.html: https://mk-fg.github.io/fgtk/scraps/d3-du-disk-space-usage-layout.html

asciitree-parse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Py3 script to parse output of asciitree.LeftAligned tree, as produced by
`asciitree module`_ (see module docs for format examples).

Can be embedded into python code as a parser for easily-readable trees of
strings, without need to abuse YAML or something less-readable for those.

.. _asciitree module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asciitree/0.3.3

glusterfs-xattr-trusted-to-user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script (python3) to copy trusted.\* xattrs to user.\* and/or wipe out either one
of these.

Useful when running patched glusterd in a container, as described in
`running-glusterfs-in-a-user-namespace blog post here`_, and probably not much else.

.. _running-glusterfs-in-a-user-namespace blog post here: http://blog.fraggod.net/2017/03/21/running-glusterfs-in-a-user-namespace-uid-mapped-container.html

led-blink-arg
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Py3 script to blink bit-pattern from a passed argument using linux led subsystem
(i.e. one of the leds in /sys/class/leds).

Useful to make e.g. RPi boards booted from identical OS img distinguishable by
blinking last bits of their IP address, MAC, serial number or stuff like that.

led-blink-seq
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Py3 script to blink any arbitrary on/off sequence or numbers (using bits) on an
LED, using sysfs interface (/sys/class/leds or /sys/class/gpio).

Sequence is expressed using simple embedded language, for example::

  +1s r:5 [ -100 +100 ] -1.5s 237 -5s <

Where:

- ``{ '+' | '-' }{ ms:int | s:float 's' }`` (e.g. "+100", "+1s", "-1.5s") is a
  simple on/off state for specified number of seconds or ms.

- ``r[epeat]:{N}`` (e.g. "r:5") instructs to repeat next command N times.

- ``[ ... ]`` is used to group commands for repeating.

- Simple number (or more complex ``n[/bits][-dec]`` form) will be blinked in
  big-endian bit order with 150ms for 0, 1.3s for 1 and 700ms in-between these
  (see BlinkConfig, also adjustable via ``bit-repr:{bit1_ms),{bit0_ms),{interval_ms)``
  command).

- ``<`` repeats whole thing from the start forever.

Somewhat easier than writing one-off "set(0), sleep(100), set(1), ..." scripts
with mostly boilerplate or extra deps for this simple purpose.

gue-tunnel
^^^^^^^^^^

Bash script to setup/destroy GRE tunnel with Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE).

One command instead of bunch of them, with some built-in templating to make it
easier to use on identical remote hosts.

wifi-client-match
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic script to automate `wpa_supplicant`_ matching AP in a python3 script
(e.g. by ssid regexp or any other parameters), pick best/working BSSID and
connect to it.

For cases when wpa_supplicant.conf is not powerful enough.

Python3, uses dbus-python module and its glib eventloop.

.. _hostapd: https://w1.fi/hostapd/

mem-search-replace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unfinished simple python3 script to search/replace memory of a process via
process_vm_readv / process_vm_writev calls while it's running.

Useful for hacks to update stuff in running binary apps without having to
restart or disrupt them in any way, but found that this approach was too tedious
in my specific case due to how stuff is stored there, so didn't bother with
process_vm_writev part.

gpm-track
^^^^^^^^^

Py3 script to capture and print mouse events from GPM_ (as in libgpm) in
specified tty.

Main event receiver is gpm-track.c (build with ``gcc -O2 gpm-track.c -o
gpm-track -lgpm -lrt``) proxy-binary though, which writes latest mouse position
to mmap'ed shared memory file (under /dev/shm) and sends SIGRT* signals to main
process on mouse clicks.

Python wrapper runs that binary and reads position at its own pace,
reacting to clicks immediately via signals.

Such separation can be useful to have python only receive click events while C
binary tracks position and draws cursor itself in whatever fashion (e.g. on a
top-level layer via RPi's OpenVG API), without needing to do all that separate
low-latency work in python.

Note that GPM tracks x/y in row/column format, not pixels, which isn't very
useful for GUIs, alas.
